## Overview

This project is a comprehensive MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) project focused on analyzing YouTube data. It leverages the principles of the cookiecutter data science project template to create a robust, reproducible, and scalable workflow. This project includes data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, prediction, and visualization.

## Project Goals

*   **Data Acquisition:** Gather relevant data from YouTube or other relevant sources.
*   **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis and modeling.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Extract meaningful features from the raw data to improve model performance.
*   **Model Development:** Develop and train machine learning models to address specific analytical goals related to YouTube.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the models and fine-tune as needed.
*   **Prediction:** Use the trained models to make predictions on new or unseen YouTube data.
*   **Visualization:** Create insightful visualizations to explore the data and communicate findings.
*   **Deployment:**  Make the model available for production or to be used in future analysis.
*   **MLOps Pipeline:** Implement an efficient MLOps pipeline for data management, model training, and deployment.

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard cookiecutter data science project structure for organization and reproducibility:
